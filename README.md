# webapp

This is an interactive webapp that I created at the SafeHack Hackathon. The idea was to create an interactive learning site where people
would learn more about safe websites and none safe websites. 

safe websites can protect your information in their database when you enter them online, bad websites can't.

this platform would also have a few tutorials on cyber security.
